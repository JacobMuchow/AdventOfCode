# Advent of Code Solutions

## My sappy story

I discovered [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in December 2023 while I was working at [Topaz Labs](https://topazlabs.com). A few of the engineers got to talking about the problems and the advent calendar and I found I quite enjoyed working on them! Currently I am the Director of Engineering at Topaz and while I get to write code fairly regularly, many days are focused on meetings and interviews and I don't always get the coding stimulation I love that got me into programming in the first place when I was a kid. I quickly found Advent was a great way for me to enjoy coding again in my free time by allowing me to focus on some finite problems for an hour or two when I can and just enjoy that, without being too big a commitment.

I've been able to share the joy of Advent with some coding friends and I hope you can find some too! Or if you are here for inspiration, I hope my solutions are helpful to you! 

## About the repo

I am using a different language for each year. This lets me learn things about multiple languages, from ones I'm very familiar with to brand new languages when I'm up for it! And keep things fresh as well.

I try to write code here in a way that is straight forward with reasonable efficiency, rather than a code golf or pure optimization type of style. Including having the solutions be mostly self-contained instead of using a ton of dependencies other than regex and file readers.
