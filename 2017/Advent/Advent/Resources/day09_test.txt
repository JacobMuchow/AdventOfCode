{}, score of 1.
{{{}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
{{},{}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
{{{},{},{{}}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16.
{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, score of 1.
{{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.
{{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.
{{<a!>},{<a!>},{<a!>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 = 3.

<<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.
<{!>}>, because the first > is canceled.
